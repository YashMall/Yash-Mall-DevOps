# Hello World Java Application 🚀

This project is a simple Java Hello World application built using Maven. It was developed as part of an assignment to learn the basics of Java development, version control using Git, and continuous integration with Jenkins.

## 🎯 Project Overview
This project involves creating a Maven-based Java application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Additionally, version control is handled through Git, and Jenkins is set up for continuous integration (CI).

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Java**: Basic Java programming for console output.
- **Maven**: Used for managing project dependencies and building the project.
- **Git**: Version control system to track changes and manage code.
- **GitHub**: Remote repository for hosting the project.
- **Jenkins**: Automation server for setting up continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD).

## 📝 Assignment Tasks

### Task 1: Create a Maven-based Java Hello World application
- A simple Java application was developed that prints `Hello, World!` to the console.
- **Java Code**:
    ```java
    public class App {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("Hello, World!");
        }
    }
    ```

### Task 2: Create a GitHub repository
- A GitHub repository named `hello-world-java` was created to host this project.
- Link to repository: [GitHub - hello-world-java](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/hello-world-java)

### Task 3: Install Git client
- Git was installed on the local machine to manage the project version control.

### Task 4: Configure Git and push the project to GitHub
- The local Maven project was initialized as a Git repository.
- The project was then pushed to the remote GitHub repository.

### Task 5: Install and configure Jenkins
- Jenkins was downloaded and installed on the local machine to enable CI for the project.
- A job was set up in Jenkins to automate the build process using Maven.

## 🌟 Key Takeaways
This project helped in gaining a practical understanding of the following concepts:
- **Java Development**: Gained hands-on experience with Java and Maven for building simple applications.
- **Version Control**: Learned how to effectively manage code changes using Git and GitHub.
- **CI/CD**: Configured Jenkins to automate the build process, highlighting the importance of CI/CD pipelines in modern development workflows.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project Locally
